        <h1>How to Host a Static Website on AWS S3</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Welcome! In this guide, I’ll walk you through the steps I took to host this static website using Amazon S3. 
            This project is part of my learning journey as I explore AWS to build my cloud portfolio.</p>

        <ol>
            <li id="left">
                <h4>Create an S3 Bucket</h4>
                <p>I started by creating an Amazon S3 bucket. This is where all the website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are stored.</p>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Upload Website Files</h4>
                <p>After creating the bucket, I uploaded the website files to the bucket, including this page you’re reading now!</p>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Enable Static Website Hosting</h4>
                <p>I enabled Static Website Hosting in the bucket’s properties. This turns the S3 bucket into a public-facing website that anyone can access.</p>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Set Permissions</h4>
                <p>To make the site public, I had to set permissions in the S3 bucket policy, allowing users to view my website by accessing the files in the bucket.</p>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Access the Website</h4>
                <p>Once the setup was done, I got a public URL from AWS where the site is hosted. This is where you are reading this guide!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="left">What I’ve Learned:</h3>
