        <h1>How to Host a Static Website on AWS S3</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Welcome! In this guide, I’ll walk you through the steps I took to host this static website using Amazon S3 and set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub. This project is part of my learning journey as I explore AWS and build my cloud portfolio.</p>
        <h3 id="left">Step-by-Step Guide: Hosting a Website with Amazon S3 and CI/CD</h3>
        <ol>
            <li id="left">
                <h4>Create an S3 Bucket</h4>
                <p>I started by creating an Amazon S3 bucket. This is where all the website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are stored.</p>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Upload Website Files</h4>
                <p>After creating the bucket, I uploaded the website files to the bucket, including this page you’re reading now!</p>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Enable Static Website Hosting</h4>
                <p>I enabled Static Website Hosting in the bucket’s properties. This turns the S3 bucket into a public-facing website that anyone can access.</p>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Set Permissions</h4>
                <p>To make the site public, I had to set permissions in the S3 bucket policy, allowing users to view my website by accessing the files in the bucket. I used the aws policy generator to generate the "s3:GetObject" policy.</p>

            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Set Up Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)</h4>
                <p>After deploying the website, I initiated a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub. Now, anytime I push changes to my GitHub main branch, the website in the S3 bucket is automatically updated.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Created an IAM User:</b> I created a user in AWS and attached the AmazonS3FullAccess policy to grant the necessary permissions for accessing and updating the S3 bucket.</li>
                    <li><b>Generated Access Keys:</b> I generated an access key and secret key for the user.</li>
                    <li><b>Configured GitHub:</b> I added the access keys to my GitHub repository as secrets, allowing GitHub to interact with my S3 bucket securely.</li>
                    <li><b>Created a Workflow File:</b> I wrote a workflow YAML file in GitHub that defines what happens whenever I push changes to the main branch. This file triggers the automatic deployment to the S3 bucket.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li id="left">
                <h4>Access the Website</h4>
                <p>Once the setup was done, I got a public URL from AWS where the site is hosted. This is where you are reading this guide!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="left">What I’ve Learned and demonstrated:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li id="left"><b>Amazon S3 Basics:</b> I learned how to create an S3 bucket and upload files.</li>
            <li id="left"><b>Static Website Hosting:</b> I understood how AWS S3 can host static websites without a need for servers.</li>
            <li id="left"><b>Bucket Policies:</b> I configured permissions using bucket policies to control access.</li>
            <li id="left"><b>CI/CD with GitHub:</b> I implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy updates to the S3 bucket whenever I push changes to GitHub. This improves the workflow by automating deployments.</li>
            <li id="left"><b>IAM and Security:</b> I gained experience in creating IAM users, managing access keys, and securely integrating GitHub with AWS.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="left">This is just the beginning of my AWS learning journey. Stay tuned for more projects as I explore AWS services and cloud computing.</p>
